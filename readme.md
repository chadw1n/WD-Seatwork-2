## Overview
This project shows my skills in building creative and dynamic hero sections for the web. Each hero highlights different design ideas, like floating images, video backgrounds, and smooth hover animations, to make every page feel unique and engaging. I focused on making the layouts responsive so they look good on any screen size, and added subtle interactive details to enhance the user experience. Using only HTML and CSS, I aimed to explore different visual styles and learn how to create modern, eye-catching sections that can be used in real websites. This project helped me improve my design thinking and front-end development skills at the same time.


### Key Components
- Multi-page website with five different hero sections
- Animated effects and hover interactions
- Easy navigation with Prev, Home, and Next buttons
- Floating image
- Slider feature

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   |   └─ style.css
